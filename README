This is far from being finished yet.
Keep in touch or simply send patches!


To build simply do:

	perl Makefile.PL && make && make test


Under OS X you need to link the library by hand, because the toolchain fails to
do it :(

	perl Makefile.PL && make && ./osx-link.sh && make test


To run the unit tests individually simply do:

	perl -Mblib t/git.t
